# iocost-benchmarks-ci

This repository contains the scripts which are used to process benchmarks
which are submitted to the [iocost-benchmarks](https://github.com/iocost-benchmark/iocost-benchmarks/)
repository by users of [resctl-bench](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/resctl-demo).

GitHub actions builds the CI scripts with two separate pipelines producing these
artifacts:
 - `iocost-benchmarks-ci` contains built CI scripts from this repository
 - `resctl-demo` contains resctl-demo binaries
